# Mini-Securonix-API
This project is a lightweight web api server that serves API response calls documented in the Securonix Web Services documentation. It serves as a companion project to the Securonix.PowerShell.CLI repository. The purpose of using this project is to test simple commands and workflows without touching a production Securonix instance. In no way does this application function as a SIEM. Because this project is developed from online available documentation, it may not respond to all commands available in a real Securonix Web API.

This is not a production level application.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download and install the .NET 6.0 SDK.
2. Build and launch the project.
